# Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection
💳 Credit Card Fraud Detection
A machine learning project to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using the popular creditcard.csv dataset. This notebook explores data preprocessing, visualization, and classification algorithms to effectively identify fraud cases in an imbalanced dataset.

# 📌 Project Overview
Credit card fraud is a major issue in today's digital economy. This project aims to:
* Analyze and understand the dataset.
* Handle imbalanced class distribution.
* Train models to detect fraudulent transactions.
* Evaluate performance using appropriate metrics.
